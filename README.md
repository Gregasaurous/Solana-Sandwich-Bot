# MEV MUNCHER v1.0 - A Solana Sandwich Bot

After two months, we have successfully cloned Jito's MempoolStream! Currently we are seeing roughly 10000 transactions per minute come into our mempool.  About ~30% of those transactions are swaps.  And ~10% of those swaps can be sandwiched.  That's 300 transactions per minute we can sandwich.  And that number is growing every day. 

## ACCESS NOW OPEN

For a very limited time we are allowing new members to join the pool.

## Why would you open access to this? 
Validators.  We need more validators.  They are our only limiting factor right now.  Over the next few months, we will have accrued enough SOL to have a nice fleet, but we need them NOW!  This is why we are opening access to a select few applicants.
